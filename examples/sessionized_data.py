"""Sessionized Data - Map/Reduce Pattern.
https://docs.malloydata.dev/documentation/patterns/sessionize

Flight event data contains dep_time, carrier, origin, destination and tail_num
(the plane that made the flight). The query below takes the flight event data
and maps it into sessions of flight_date, carrier, and tail_num. For each session,
a nested list of flight_legs by the aircraft on that day. The flight legs are numbered.
